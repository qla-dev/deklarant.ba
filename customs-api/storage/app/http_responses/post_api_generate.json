The user wants me to extract structured JSON data from the given invoice in Markdown. First, I need to parse the document carefully.\n\nLooking at the markdown, there's an invoice with some details. The main content under \"Date of Total Description of goods Price per Quantity Delivery Unit Amount EUR EUR\" seems to be the line items. The first line after that is \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". \n\nBreaking this down: \"1120 Bag\" is the quantity and unit. The item name here is \"Palm Oil-CP10\", and the price per unit is 0.68 EUR per liter. The total amount is 16,755.20 EUR. The original name should be exactly as in the document, so \"Palm Oil-CP10\" with the \"li.\" and \"per L.\" parts. Wait, the price is listed as \"0,68 per L.\" which uses a comma as the decimal separator. I need to convert that to a decimal number, so 0.68. The currency is EUR, as specified in the headers.\n\nNext, there's a line: \"Origin Malaysia Brend; GOLDEN OIL Packing 20 kg Bagi Bags (22 li) advance 5025,66 High Refined Bleached And Deodorised 11.729,54 Pal Olein.\" This seems like a continuation of the same item's description. The numbers here might be part of the description, not the actual price or quantity. The \"5025,66\" and \"11.729,54\" could be other values, but since the user wants only line items with quantity, unit price, etc., these might not be part of the item's price. The original name here is \"Pal Olein\", but the main item is still Palm Oil-CP10. \n\nI need to check if there are other items. The rest of the text includes payment terms, container numbers, and other totals which are not line items. The \"Total Politics 2013-2019 2000\" and similar lines are probably not items. \n\nSo, the only line item here is the Palm Oil-CP10 with quantity 1120, unit \"Bag\", unit price 0.68 EUR, total 16,755.20 EUR. The original name is \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L.\" Wait, the original name should be exactly as in the document. The line is \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". But the original name is the raw text from the document. However, the user says to include any description, label numbers, etc. So the original name would be the entire line up to the price? Or just the item name part? \n\nWait, the rules say for original_name: \"Raw original name from scanned document, must be exactly the same as in the document, including any description, label numbers, item name, etc.\" So the original name should be the exact text that represents the item's name in the document. In this case, the line starts with \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L.\" So the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\" but including the \"Jan.2020\" and \"24640 li.\"? Or is that part of the delivery date or other info?\n\nHmm, the line is structured as \"Date of Total Description of goods Price per Quantity Delivery Unit Amount EUR EUR 1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". So the columns are: Date of, Total, Description of goods, Price per, Quantity, Delivery, Unit, Amount, EUR, EUR. Wait, maybe the headers are misaligned. Let me parse the headers again.\n\nThe header line is: \"Date of Total Description of goods Price per Quantity Delivery Unit Amount EUR EUR\". That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's supposed to be columns like Date, Total, Description, Price per, Quantity, Delivery, Unit, Amount, EUR, EUR. But the actual line is \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". \n\nAssuming that the first part \"1120 Bag\" is the quantity and unit, then \"Palm Oil-CP10\" is the item name. The \"Jan.2020\" might be the delivery date. The \"24640 li.\" could be another value, but the price per is \"0,68 per L.\" and the total is \"16.755,20\". \n\nSo the original name should be the exact text from the document for the item. The item's original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\" but the line includes \"Jan.2020\" and \"24640 li.\" which might be part of the description. However, the user says to include any description, label numbers, etc. So perhaps the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\"? But that seems like it's mixing different fields. Alternatively, maybe the \"24640 li.\" is part of the price or quantity. \n\nWait, the price per is \"0,68 per L.\" and the total is \"16.755,20\". The quantity is 1120 Bag. The unit is \"Bag\". The \"24640 li.\" might be a different unit, but the user's instruction is to extract the quantity and unit from the context. The quantity is 1120, unit is Bag. The \"24640 li.\" could be liters, but since the unit price is per liter, maybe the total is 1120 bags * 22 liters per bag (as mentioned in the description \"Packing 20 kg Bagi Bags (22 li)\"). So 1120 * 22 = 24,640 liters. That makes sense. So the \"24640 li.\" is the total liters, but the quantity is 1120 bags. \n\nTherefore, the original name for the item is \"Palm Oil-CP10\" with the additional details in the description. But according to the rules, the original_name should be exactly as in the document. The line in the document for the item is \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". So the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\"? Or is the \"Jan.2020\" part of the delivery date? \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The user's instruction says to include any description, label numbers, item name, etc. So the original name should be the exact text from the document that represents the item's name. In this case, the item's name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\", but the line includes \"Jan.2020\" and \"24640 li.\" which might be part of the description. However, the user says to include any description, so perhaps the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" But that seems like it's including the delivery date and total liters. Alternatively, maybe the \"Jan.2020\" is the delivery date, and \"24640 li.\" is the total liters, which are part of the description. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest approach is to take the original name as the exact text from the document for the item's name. The line is \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". The item's name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\", but the rest of the text might be part of the description. However, the user's instruction says to include any description, label numbers, etc. So perhaps the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Jan.2020\" is the delivery date, and \"24640 li.\" is the total liters. The item name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\", and the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\" with the additional details in the description. But the user says to include any description, label numbers, etc. So perhaps the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" \n\nIn any case, the human-readable item_name would be \"Palm Oil CP10\" (removing the hyphen if necessary, but the original name has the hyphen). The quantity is 1120, unit is Bag. The unit price is 0.68 EUR per liter. The total is 16,755.20 EUR. \n\nThe currency is EUR, as specified in the headers. \n\nSo the JSON should have one item with these details. The original name is the exact text from the document for the item's name, which is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\"? Or just \"Palm Oil-CP10\"? \n\nLooking back at the document line: \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". The \"Palm Oil-CP10\" is the item name, followed by \"Jan.2020\" (delivery date?), \"24640 li.\" (total liters), then price per liter, and total amount. So the original name should be \"Palm Oil-CP10\" but including the \"Jan.2020\" and \"24640 li.\" as part of the description. However, the user says to include any description, label numbers, etc. So the original name is the entire text from the document that represents the item's name. \n\nTherefore, the original_name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" and the item_name is \"Palm Oil CP10\" (human-readable). \n\nWait, but the user says for original_name: \"Raw original name from scanned document, must be exactly the same as in the document, including any description, label numbers, item name, etc.\" So the original name should be the exact text from the document that represents the item's name. In this case, the line is \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". The item's name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\", but the rest of the text is part of the description. However, the user says to include any description, label numbers, etc. So the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\"? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original name is just \"Palm Oil-CP10\" and the rest is part of the description. But the user's instruction says to include any description, so perhaps the original name is the entire line up to the price. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but given the rules, the original name should be the exact text from the document. The line is \"1120 Bag Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li. 0,68 per L. 16.755,20\". The item's name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\", but the rest is part of the description. However, the user says to include any description, label numbers, etc. So the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to take the original name as the exact text from the document that represents the item's name. In this case, the item's name is \"Palm Oil-CP10\", and the rest is part of the description. However, the user says to include any description, so perhaps the original name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the original name as \"Palm Oil-CP10\" and the item_name as \"Palm Oil CP10\". But I need to check the rules again. \n\nRule 4 says: \"In case you are unsure what the item is, put value of original_name into item_name. Never put 'unknown' in item_name.\" So if I'm unsure, I should use the original_name as the item_name. \n\nIn this case, I'm not entirely sure if the \"Jan.2020\" and \"24640 li.\" are part of the item name or the description. Since the user says to include any description, label numbers, etc., in the original_name, I should include them. \n\nTherefore, the original_name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" and the item_name is \"Palm Oil CP10 Jan 2020 24640 liters\". \n\nWait, but the user says to use the human-readable description for item_name. So \"Palm Oil CP10\" with the delivery date and total liters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the item_name is \"Palm Oil CP10\" and the original_name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" \n\nThis is a bit tricky, but I'll proceed with the original_name as the exact text from the document for the item's name, which is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" and the item_name as \"Palm Oil CP10 Jan 2020 24640 liters\". \n\nBut the user's example shows that the original_name is the raw text, so I need to capture that exactly. \n\nSo the original_name is \"Palm Oil-CP10 Jan.2020 24640 li.\" and the item_name is \"Palm Oil CP10 Jan 2020 24640 liters\". \n\nThe quantity is 1120, unit is Bag. The unit price is 0.68 EUR per liter.
